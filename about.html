        <p>Multiplex Street Parking started in a humble way in 2003 when it was contracted by Kampala City Council (KCC) to manage and control Street Parking in Kampala.<br> In 2010, we were contracted by Kampala Capital City Authority to Manage and Modernise Street Parking with the objective of procuring & deploying the technologies below;</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Pay and Display parking meters.</li>
              <li>Hand held meters - Point of Sale Machines (POS).</li>
              <li>Automated Number plate recognition System.</li>
              <li>The parking devices were hiked to the central server<br>which  facilitated monitoring of parking operations.</li>
            </ul>
    <p>In 2017, following a review of parking technologies in use, it was determined that P&D Meters were not suitable for our environment where voluntary compliance among <br>motorists is low and network coverage is poor leading to unstable connectivity.<br> The ANPRS mounted on pick-ups were also not very effective in capturing Motor vehicle number plates for vehicles parked bumper to bumper. <br>The review revealed that the most effective technology would be Android POS Machines with real time connectivity to Central Server.</p>      
    <p>In 2017/ 2018, KCCA revised the Contract and required that the parking management system in use be revamped and realigned to the ideals of Smart City. <br>Currently we use the POS machines which are used for invoicing and also to detect defaulting vehicles and notify Enforcement Personnel providing vehicle number and its physical location.</p>
